CHAPTER1 
    database management system DBMS veritabani yonetim sistemidir 
    veri tabani icindeki verileri yonetiminis aglayan yapilari 
    icerir

    database yonetimi hem veri semalari tanimlamalarini hem de db 
    icindeki verilerin yonetimi asamalarini icerir. 

    DATABASE SYSTEM APPICATIONS 
    => Enterprise information (sales manufacturings..)
    => Banking and Finance 
    => universities 
    => Airlines 
    => Telecomminication 


    PURPOSE OF DATABASE SYSTEMS 
    

    BEFORE DATABASE SYSTEMS 
    Before the database systems informations are kept in the large files 
    and file systems has lots of disadvantages such as
    -Data redundancy and inconsistancy 
    -Difficulty in accessing data 
    -Data isolation 
    -Integrity problem 
    -Atomicity problems 
    -Concurrent Access anomalies 
    -Security problems 

    => Neyseki gunumuzde gelistirilmis olan ibm,microsoft oracle db gibi
       veri tabani yonetim sistemleri sayesinde verilerin degistirilmesi 
       tanimlanmasi ve guvenligi dosyalarla saglanandan kat kat daha iyi 
       bir notkada. 

    

    VIEW OF DATA 
    A database system is a collection of interrelated data and a set of 
    programs that allow users to access and modify these data. 

    DATA ABSTRACTION 
    => Herkes bilgisayar bilimci olmadigi icin uygulamalarin db katmani 
       kullanicilara hisstettirilmeden arkada calisir ve on yuzde belirli 
       bir seviyede sunulur 

    =>Physical level 
        En low level abstraction seviyesidir datanin nasil saklandigi 
        bilgisine bu seviyede ulasilir. Physical level kompleks low-level
        data structurelarini detayli bir sekilde aciklar 

    =>Logical level 
        Db de nelerin hangi iliskiler ile depolandigi bilgisinin tutuldugu 
        bilgisi Logical level dedir. Database tasarimi yapan ve hangi bilginin
        db de tutulacagina karar veren kisiler logical level abstraction 
        seviyesinde kalmalilar. 


    => View model 
        En uste seviye abstraction levelidir. Sadece db nin bir kismini 
        gosterir. 

            view1 view2 view3 view4 view5 view6 ..... > users 

                            LOGICAL LEVEL      > programmers , db admin  

                            PHYSICAL LEVEL     > db admin 

    Db adminleri db programcilarindan daha cok bilgiye sahip olabilirler 
    ornegin physical seviyede hafizanin belirli addresslerinin belirli 
    dataya ayrilmis olmasi isi veya bilgisi db adminlerinde olabilir. 

    => Physical , Logical ve View katmanlarinin her birinde kullanicilarina 
        ozel olarak belirli kisitlar vardir . 


    INSTANCES AND SCHEMAS
    => Db icindeki bir tablonun satirindaki veriye INSTANCE denir 
    => Db nin genel tasarimina SCHEMA denir
    => LOGICAL SCHEMAlar nadir olarak degistirilmelidir 
    => Physical Schemalar kolayca degistirilebilirler bunun ozel olarak ismi 
        physical schema independence dir 


    PHYSICAL SCHEMA 
    =>db nin physical seviyedeki tasarimini ifade edr 


    LOGICAL SCHEMA
    => db nin logical seviyedeki tasarimini ifade eder
    => Gelistiriciler logical seviyedeki schemaya uyarak program gelistirirler  


    => Bir veri tabani view seviyesinde birden fazla view schemasina sahip 
       olabilir buna subschemas denir. (different view of schemas )

    

DATA MODELS 
    RELATIONAL MODEL 
        => Iliskisel model tablolardan olusur ve her tablonun arasinda 
        bir iliski vardir . 
        => bildigimiz tablolar ve icindeki varliklardan olusur tablolar  
        ve tablonun ozellikleri arasina bir iliski vardir 

    Entity-Relationship Model 
        => Entity ve Relationship varliklarindan olusur 


    Object Based Data Model 
        => Object Based Data model combines object oriented data model 
        and relational data model.


    Semistructured Data Model 
        => 



DATABASE LANGUAGES 
    => Veritabani sistemi hem data definition language DDL , hem de data 
    manipulation DML destegini saglamalidir. 

    => DDL ile veri tabani semalari tanimlanir 
    => DML ile de veri tabani icindeki veriler degistirilir 


    In practice, the data-definition and data-manipulation languages are not
    two separate languages; instead they simply form parts of a single database 
    language, such as the widely used SQL language

DML (Data manipulation Languages)

    PROCEDURAL DML 
    => Require a user to specify what data are needed and how to get those data 

    DECLERATIVE DML or NONPROCEDURAL DMLs 
    => Require a user to specify what data are needed without specifying how to 
    get those data 

    A query is a statement requesting the retrieval of information. The portion of
    a DML that involves information retrieval is called a query language.   


DDL (Data Definition Languages)
    => Database semalari DDL dilleri kullanilarak yapilir. 
    => Db icindeki veriler DDL tarafindan saglanan consistency constraintsleri 
       saglamak zorundadir. 

    =>Domain Constraints
         A domain of possible values must be associated with every attribute 
        
    => Referential integrity 
        There are cases where we with to enduse that a value that appears 
        in one relation for a gibve nset of attributes also appears in certain 
        set of attributs in another relations. 

    Assertions. 
    => An assertion is any condition that the database must always satisfy.
       domain constrains and referantial integrities also kind of assertions but 
       every restrictions does not expressed bu those such as "every dos must "
       have 1 owner. 

    Authorization.
    => We may want to differentiate among the users as far as the type of
       access they are permitted on various data values in the database. 
       Most common authorizations are READ authorization, Insert Authorization , 
       UPDATE authorization , DELETE authorization. 


  => DDL ciktilari DATA DICTIONARY isimli yapilarda saklanir bu kisimlar 
     data hakkindaki bilgilerdir (data about the data)



    RELATIONAL DATABASES 
        A relational database is based on the relational model and uses a 
        collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships 
        among those data. It also includes a DML and DDL.



    DATABASE DESIN 
        Conceptual schema is developed at conceptual-design phase, which provides 
        a detailed overview of the enterprise. 

        At the end the teorideki yapi implemente edilir bu asamaya ise logical -design face 
        denir 

    ER MODELS 
        Entities are described in a database by a set of attributs . 
        Relationship is an association among several entities 
        Entity set and Relationship set consist from same type of sets or relations 


DATA STORAGE AND QUERYING 
    The functional components of a database system can be broadly dvided into 
    the STORAGE MANAGER AND QUERY PROCESSOR components. 


    STORAGE MANAGER is important because the data should be moved from memory 
    to the ssd. To reduce this we need storage manager 
    =>File manager 
    =>Transaction Manager 
    =>Buffer Manager 
    => Authorization and integrity maager 





    QUERY PROCESSOR optimizes queries and 
        The query processor is important because it helps the database system to
        simplify and facilitate access to data.

        =>DDL Interpreter 
        =>DML Compiler =>which translates DML statements in a query language into an
        evaluation plan consisting of low-level instructions that the query evaluation
        engine understands.
        
        =>Query evaluation engie => executes low level instrucions
        


TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT 
    => A transaction is a collection of operations that performs a single logical
    function in a database application. Each transaction is a unit of both atomicity
    and consistency. 

    The transaction manager consist of tthe concurrency-control and the 
    manager and the recovery manager. 


DATABASE USERS and ADMINISTRATORS 

    Naive users => unsophisticated users who interact with the system by invoking one 
                of the application programs that have been written previously 


    Application Programmers 

    Sophisticated users 
    Specialized users 

DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR 

    A person who has such central control over the system is called a 
    DATABASE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR (DBA). The responsibilities of DBA is 
    Schema Definition
    Storage structure and access-method definition 
    Schema and physical organization modification 
    Granting of authorization for data access 
    Routine manintanance
