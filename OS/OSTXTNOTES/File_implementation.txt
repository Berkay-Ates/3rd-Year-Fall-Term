                        File system implementation 
The FILE ORGANIZATION MODULE knows about files and thier logical blocks,
as well as physical blocks.

The LOGICAL FILE SYSTEM manages metadata information. Metadata includes all 
of th file-system structure except the actual data. 

A FILE CONTROL BLOCK contains information about the file including ownership 
permissions and location of the file content. 

Boot control block can contain information needed by  the system to
boot an operation system from that volume. 

A volume control block contains volume details such as the number of 
blocks in teh partition or size of the blocks 

A per-file FCB(file control block) contains many details about the files
it has a unique identifier number to allow association with a directory 
entry. 

An in-memory MOUNT TABLE contains infromation about each mounted volume 

The SYSTEM-WIDE OPEN-FILE TABLE contains a copy of the FCB of each open 
file, as well as other information. 

The PER-PROCESS OPEN-FILE TABLE contains a pointer to the appropriate 
entry in the system-wide open-file table, as well as other information 

When a process closes the file the per-process table entry is removed and 
the system-wide entry's open count is decremented. 


                        PARTITION AND MOUNTING 

The boot file locations is special for the system because at boot loading 
the system has no information about file system so there must be a special 
handling for the file system at the boot loading. 


The ROOT PARTITION which contains the operating-system kernel and sometimes 
other system files is mounted at boot time. 


                        Virtual File Systems 
To isolate the basic system call functionality from the implementation details.
The file-system implementation consist of three major layers 
1- File System interface 
2- Virtual file system VFS 
3-
